Exploratory Data Analysis of the Cars dataset

Through this comprehensive analysis of the modern Olympic Games dataset, we aimed to uncover significant patterns and insights into the Cars dataset.

In this cars dataset I performed operations of EDA like Data cleaning including handling missing values, duplicate, MICE implementation and handling outliers etc.
then performed data transfermation and scaling operations like Standardization and Normalization. In the end feature selection operations like missing value filter, correlation filter, variance filter and backward, forward and bidirectional feature selection were also performed.


Tools used in the entire process are : Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn and sci-kit learn.
